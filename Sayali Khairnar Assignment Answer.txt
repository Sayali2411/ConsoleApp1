BASIS OF COMPARISON                         ELSE IF LADDER                                  SWITCH CASE

 The control                                           In else if ladder, the control runs                      In else if ladder, the control
                                                              through the every else if                                 runs through the every else if
                                                              statement until it arrives at the                        statement until it arrives at the 
			              rue value of the statement or                          true value of the statement or
                                                              until it comes to the end of the                       until it comes to the end of the

  Working	                                            Else if ladder statement works                           Switch case statement work on the 
			           on the basis of true false                                    basis of equality operator.
 			           (zero/non-zero) basis.	


  Use of Break Statement                        In switch, the use of break statement                   In else if ladder, the use of break
			           is mandatory and very important.                        statement is not very essential.  


  Variable Data                                      Integer is the only variable data type that               Either integer or character is the variable 
                                                           can be in expression of switch.                           data type used in the expression of else if ladder

  Usage                                                Else if ladder is used when there is                       Switch case is used when there is only one condition 
                                                          multiple conditions are to be tested.                     and multiple values of the same are to be tested.

Que :- What is Collection and its Hierarchy?

Collection is a set or group of related objects. It is like the array but it has some advanced features of shrinking and growing the collection.
 Each collection is a class, which we need to declare or create the object of that class before adding any element. All collections are available in System.

hierarchy of collection :- IEnumerable is the base interface of all collections. It provides an enumerator for simple iteration. 
		     It has a method GetEnumerator() that returns an enumerator that iterates through a collection.

Que :- What is Collection Framework?

A collection is a set of similarly typed objects that are grouped together.
A collections is a set of similarly type of elements that are grouped together System.
Collection namespace contains interfaces and classes that define various collections of objects, such as lists, queue, hash tables and dictionaries, and so on.
Memory management is done automatically for all the collections. This becomes easy for a .NET developer to handle objects

Que  :- What are the interfaces available in collection?

	Interface              Description
	
	IEnumerable        Provides an enumerator which supports a simple iteration over a non-generic collection.
	
	ICollection          Defines size, enumerators and synchronization methods for all nongeneric collections.
	
	IDictionary          Represents a nongeneric collection of key/value pairs.

	IList                    Represents a non-generic collection of objects that can be individually accessed by index.

Que :- Diffrence between Array and ArrayList?

	Array                                                                                  ArrayList
                Array is strongly typed. This means that an array                  ArrayList can store any type of items\elements.
               can store only specific type of items\elements   

               In arrays we can store only one datatype either int,                In arraylist we can store all the datatype values
               string, char etc…        
 
              Array cant accept null                                                           ArrayList collection accepts null

             Arrays belong to System.Array namespace                            Arraylist belongs to System.Collection namespaces
             using System.Collections;
             using System;
	
           Example -                                                                               Example -
           int[] intArray=new int[]{2};                                                     ArrayList Arrlst = new ArrayList();
           intArray[0] = 1;                                                                      Arrlst.Add("Sagar");
           intArray[0] = 1;                                                                      Arrlst.Add(1);
           intArray[2] = 2;                                                                      Arrlst.Add(null);

Que :- Benifits of Multithreading?
 Improved performance :- Provides improvement in the performance of the processor by simultaneous execution 
		       of computation and the I/O operations.

 Minimized system resource usage :- Minimizes the use of system resources by using threads, which share the 
			      same address space and belong to the same process.

Simultaneous access to multiple applications :- Provides access to multiple applications at the same time because 
				      of quick context switching among threads.

Program structure simplification :- Simplifies the structure of complex applications, such as multimedia applications.
                                                    Each activity can be written in separate methods that makes complex program easy 
			    to design and code.

Que :- Thread Lifecycle with its various Methods?

There are following states in the life cycle of a Thread.

Unstarted :- When the instance of Thread class is created, it is in unstarted state by default.
Runnable (Ready to run) :- When start() method on the thread is called, it is in runnable or ready to run state.
Running :- Only one thread within a process can be executed at a time. At the time of execution, thread is in running state.
Not Runnable :- The thread is in not runnable state, if sleep() or wait() method is called on the thread, or input/output operation is blocked.
Dead (Terminated) :- After completing the task, thread enters into dead or terminated state.

Que :- What is SQL?
SQL is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases. SQL can be used to insert, search, update, and delete database records.
 SQL can do lots of other operations, including optimizing and maintenance of databases.

Categories of command with description
1) Data Definition Language (DDL) :- DDL changes the structure of the table like creating a table, deleting a table, altering a table, etc.
                                                    All the command of DDL are auto-committed that means it permanently save all the changes in the database.
CREATE :- It is used to create a new table in the database.
ALTER :- It is used to delete both the structure and record stored in the table.
DROP :- It is used to alter the structure of the database. This change could be either to modify the characteristics 
              of an existing attribute or probably to add a new attribute.
TRUNCATE :- It is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table.

2) Data Manipulation Language(DML) :- DML commands are used to modify the database. It is responsible for all form of changes in the database.
INSERT :- The INSERT statement is a SQL query. It is used to insert data into the row of a table.
UPDATE :- This command is used to update or modify the value of a column in the table.
DELETE :- It is used to remove one or more row from a table.

3) Data Control Language(DCL) :- DCL commands are used to grant and take back authority from any database user.
Grant :- It is used to give user access privileges to a database.
Revoke :- It is used to take back permissions from the user.

4) Transaction Control Language(TCL) :- TCL commands can only use with DML commands like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE only.
COMMIT :- Commit command is used to save all the transactions to the database.
ROLLBACK :- Rollback command is used to undo transactions that have not already been saved to the database.
SAVEPOINT :- It is used to roll the transaction back to a certain point without rolling back the entire transaction.

Que :- Data types in SQL?
CHAR :- A FIXED length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters).
VARCHAR :- VARIABLE length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters).
BINARY :-Equal to CHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size parameter specifies the column length in bytes.
VARBINARY :- Equal to VARCHAR(), but stores binary byte strings.
LONGTEXT :- Holds a string with a maximum length of 4,294,967,295 characters
INT :-  A medium integer. Signed range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647. Unsigned range is from 0 to 4294967295.
FLOAT :- floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in size.
DOUBLE :- A normal-size floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in size.
DATETIME :- A date and time combination. Format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. The supported range is from '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'.
TIMESTAMP :- A timestamp. TIMESTAMP values are stored as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch			

Que :- What is Relational Data Model?
Relational Model (RM) represents the database as a collection of relations. 
A relation is nothing but a table of values. Every row in the table represents a collection of related data values. 
These rows in the table denote a real-world entity or relationship.
